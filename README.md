# Terraform to Automate Ansible

## Proof of Concept

This short project demonstrates, in a rudimentary way, how to automate the creation of infrastructure along with using configuration files, or Ansible playbooks. A previous project in this repository shows how it is possible to use Ansible to automate the creation of a Jenkins server. The next step is to combine the two so that the Jenkins server is automatically deployed as part of an application's overall infrastructure. 

### Using along with web applications

Once the subsequent project is complete (APIFlaskDocker), along with its tests, the plan is to combine all 3 projects to automate everything from infrastructure, backend, database layer, testing, configuration, continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment, including containerisation. Upon successful completion of this stage, the app will be redeployed using monitoring and logging software.

This project will now be combined with others to build an application on a Jenkins server
